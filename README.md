### RUNNING TEST FILES
The test files are in the ./testfiles directory, this is so as to differentiate mandatory project files from self made test files and to keep the working directory unclutered. All the main.c files used to test the individual tasks are in this directory.

Edit the make file and create a rule for the task to test,
then run make taskn where "n" is the the task number e.g 
```make task1```
