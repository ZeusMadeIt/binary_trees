### RUNNING TEST FILES
The test files are in the ./tfs directory, this is so as to differentiate mandatory project files from self made test files and to keep the working directory unclutered.

Edit the make file and create a rule for the task to test,
the run make taskn where "n" is the number of the task e.g 
```make task1```
